# Hi, I'm Orlando üëã

I'm a **Full-Stack Developer** with a background in **HVAC** (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning). After years of troubleshooting and problem-solving in HVAC, I decided to pivot into tech and pursue my passion for software development.

My journey began with learning full-stack development using **React, Node.js, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL**. After completing my coding bootcamp, I dove into **TypeScript and Docker**, learning them on the fly with new projects! I love tackling complex problems and continuously expanding my knowledge of new technologies, bringing the same troubleshooting mindset I had in HVAC to my coding practice.

Whether it's fixing a faulty HVAC system or debugging a code issue, I enjoy diving into challenges and finding elegant solutions. 

When I'm not working on new projects, I'm usually riding the motorcycle, solving what the gf wants to eat, learning more in jiujitsu, playing with the fur babies, or playing video games!
